Tolkien. For some features of the mod, notably Harad and Rh\u00c3\u00bbn, we have invented our own content based on sensible extrapolations from Tolkien's writings, in order to present a more complete world and playing experience. However, those concerned about canon should be careful not to treat the content of this mod as an authoritative adaptation of Tolkien's works. Our adaptation is intended to be faithful to the spirit of Middle-earth, but it is only one possible interpretation of what might have lain within those empty spaces on the map."};
