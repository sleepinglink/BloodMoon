Good day, #. Have I seen you around these parts before?
If you're looking to hire Shirriffs, you'll have to earn a bit of prestige first.
You're looking to hire my Shirriffs? Firstly, you're one of the Big Folk, and secondly, I haven't even heard of you!
Good day, #.
You don't look like you're from around these parts, #.
How are things in the Shire today, #?
You shan't be hiring any of my Shirriffs until I know I can trust you a bit more!
And what are you after, #? You'll have to prove I can trust you if you want to hire my Shirriffs.
Don't worry, I'm supposed to be in this here tavern... yes, I'm off-duty. Yes, that's it.
Even we Shirriff Chiefs have to have some time off, #!
No, I'm not drunk, #. Not drunk at all.
This ale is delicious! Oh - what do you want?
How long have I been in this tavern, you ask? Well that's none of your business!
Hello, #! You're a new face in this farthing. I've not seen you before.
If you want some of my fine Hobbits to serve you, you'll have to do some more favours for the folk here first, #.
I've not seen you before!
I've not seen one of you Big Folk for a while. 
You'll need to do more good deeds if you want some of my Shirriffs, #.
